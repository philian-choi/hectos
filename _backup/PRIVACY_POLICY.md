# Privacy Policy for Hectos

**Effective Date:** January 11, 2026

**Hectos** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.

## 1. Zero Data Collection Policy (Serverless)
Hectos operates as a **serverless application**. We do not operate a backend server, and we do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data, workout logs, or usage habits on any external servers.

**All data is generated and stored locally on your device.**

## 2. Information We Access

### A. Front Camera (Face Detection)
We use your device's **front camera** to detect your face position during pushup exercises. This enables our **automatic counting feature** — the core of Hectos.
- Face detection happens **entirely on-device** using Apple's Vision framework.
- **No video is ever recorded, saved, or transmitted.** The camera feed is processed in real-time and immediately discarded.
- We cannot see you. We cannot identify you. We only detect "face down" vs "face up" to count reps.

### B. Motion Sensors
We use your device's **Light Sensor** (or similar optical sensors) and **Accelerometers** solely for the purpose of automatically counting your pushups.
- This sensor data is processed in real-time on your device.
- It is **never recorded, saved, or transmitted** anywhere.

### C. Local Storage
Your workout progress, daily records, and settings are stored locally on your device using your phone's internal storage.
- If you delete the app, this data will be permanently removed (unless you have engaged iOS/Android system-level backups).

## 3. Third-Party Services
We do not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Mixpanel) to track your individual behavior.
- **In-App Purchases**: Transactions are processed directly through Apple's App Store. We receive only a confirmation of purchase to unlock features, without receiving your payment details or personal identity.

## 4. Why We Request Permissions
- **Camera Usage**: To detect your face position during pushups for automatic counting. All processing is on-device.
- **Motion Usage**: To detect your position during exercise for automatic counting.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Since we do not collect user emails, please review this policy periodically within the app or on our App Store page.
