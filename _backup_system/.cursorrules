# BMad Method: Zero-Lie & Perfect App Protocol

## 1. Definition of Done (DoD)
The Agent MUST NOT declare a task "complete" until:
1. **Build Verification**: `npx expo run:ios` (Local Build) passes successfully.
2. **Logic Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` returns zero errors.
3. **Business Logic**: For IAP related tasks, `finishTransaction` and listeners MUST be implemented.
4. **App Store Ready**: The app must be in a state ready for submission (No "To Do", No broken assets).

## 2. Integrity Protocol
- NEVER say "It works" if you haven't seen the build log.
- NEVER skip Gate 3 (Native Build) for speed. Speed comes from correctness, not shortcuts.
- If a Native Module (`react-native-iap`, `expo-sensors`) is used, verify its compatibility with the current Expo SDK.

## 3. IAP & Payment Checklist
- Global `purchaseUpdatedListener` is MANDATORY.
- `finishTransaction` is MANDATORY to prevent payment deadlocks.
- A "Fail-Safe" mode must exist for TestFlight/Reviewers when Store is unreachable.
